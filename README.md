# Ridge and Lasso Regression - by udion

This is to implement the codes which can perform the ridge and lasso and in general any p-norm (1<=p<=2)
based regularised regression and demonstrate some results

# About Dataset being used
## DATASET INFORMATION:

Dataset has the temperature, humidity in various parts of a house and the general weather conditions, the goal is to predict the energy used by the appliances in the house in Wh(Watt-hour).
The dataset used here is a standard dataset which was polluted with noise.
